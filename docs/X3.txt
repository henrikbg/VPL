Ms. Appleworth is a mathematics teacher and is teaching his students about cubic equations. He needs you to findthe integer solutions to some cubic equations for him. The equations are in the form ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0. 
He knows all of the solutions will be in the range [-100 100]. He has asked you to write a program that will find thesesolutions for him.

Input
The first line of input will contain a single integer n that indicates the number of equations to follow. Each of thefollowing n lines will contain four integers in the form a b c d representing the values of the coefficients a, b,c, and d respectively of the equation that is in the formof the equation above. Each of items will be separated by a space.

Output
For each equation, you will list, on a single line and folled by a space, the integer solutions to the equation. A spaceat the end of the line is optional. If no solution in the above interval exists, print NO INTEGER SOLUTION.
